# Deep_Learning_SKin

#Introduction
Skin cancer can be simply defined as the growth in the skin
which happens due to damage to the skin cells. This research is
based on the detection of various skin diseases both non
melanoma and melanoma, using deep learning techniques known
as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the image
dataset. The image dataset comprises of nine classes of skin
disease which is the input to the algorithm. Many research have
been performed on skin cancer detection and they all focus on a
particular class which is melanoma, this is because it is a major
causes of skin cancer, but it is important to note that other nonmelanoma may result into challenging issues if not detected and
treated early. The aim of this research is to encourage the
accurate detection of different nine classes of skin cancer which
may be difficult during diagnosis. This is achieved using
Convolutional Neural Network models. The CNN used includes
custom CNN, VGG16 and ResNet18. Custom CNN has 5
Conv2d and MaxPool2d, 8 activation function (ReLu) and 4 fully
connected layers. The collected dataset has 2239 training
samples and 118 test samples. 15% of the training samples were
taken for validation.
